Real Time Bus Tracker

Description:
This project is a real-time bus tracker utilizing the Google Maps JavaScript API and the MBTA API to display the current locations of buses on a map. It fetches live data of bus locations from the MBTA API and updates the markers on the map accordingly, providing users with accurate information about the buses in operation.

How to Run:

Ensure you have an internet connection.
Open the HTML file in a web browser.
The map will load with markers representing bus locations.
The markers will update automatically every 15 seconds.

Roadmap of Future Improvements:

Customization Options: Allow users to customize the map view, such as zoom level and map type.
Real-Time Bus Information: Display additional information about each bus, such as route number and destination.
Error Handling: Implement better error handling for cases where API requests fail or there's an issue with the map initialization.
Mobile Optimization: Optimize the layout and functionality for mobile devices to enhance user experience.
User Interaction: Enable user interaction with the map, such as clicking on markers to see more details about buses.
