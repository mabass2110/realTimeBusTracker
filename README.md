# Real Time Bus Tracker

## Description:
This project is a real-time bus tracker utilizing the Google Maps JavaScript API and the MBTA API to display the current locations of buses on a map. It fetches live data of bus locations from the MBTA API and updates the markers on the map accordingly, providing users with accurate information about the buses in operation.

## How to Run:
1. Ensure you have an internet connection.
2. Open the HTML file in a web browser.
3. The map will load with markers representing bus locations.
4. The markers will update automatically every 15 seconds.

## Roadmap of Future Improvements:
1. Customization Options:** Allow users to customize the map view, such as zoom level and map type.
2. Real-Time Bus Information:** Display additional information about each bus, such as route number and destination.
3. Error Handling:** Implement better error handling for cases where API requests fail or there's an issue with the map initialization.
4. Mobile Optimization:** Optimize the layout and functionality for mobile devices to enhance user experience.
5. User Interaction:** Enable user interaction with the map, such as clicking on markers to see more details about buses.
